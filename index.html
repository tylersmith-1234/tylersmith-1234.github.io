            <p>
              I was fortunate enough to do three rotations as a co-op for Itential, where I got a lot of exposure to the software engineering industry.
              During my time there, I helped update features, create new features for their product, and learn some of the processes & norms commonly used in software development.

              I did this internship in conjunction with the rest of my schoolwork, which helped me learn how to balance my work, school, and the rest of my life.
              Our main goal was to make a so-called "hydrocommunications" device--basically, to see if we could create a way of communication via water waves and buoys.
              That was one of my first significant experiences with failure: we did not achieve our goal, but we were able to look back in the process and reflect on what went right and what went wrong during our development.

            The second part of my BSMS program at Georgia Tech, I anticipate graduating in May 2022 with my MS. I will be specializing in Machine Learning.

          <p>Thanks to Georgia Tech, I had an excellent experience as an undergraduate CS major, and I was able to expand my horizons with regards to computer science and learn more about both research and industry.
            My concentrations were in People and Intelligence--for more information on GT's unique Threads program, click <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/threads-better-way-learn-computing">here.</a>
            I was even able to get a head start on my Master's Degree, thanks to their BS/MS program.
            Probably my most significant experience here has been helping out with CS 4400 as a TA since my sophomore year. I have now seen what college classes are like as both a student and an instructor, which has helped me appreciate my education even more.

        <p>I was fortunate enough to go to a very good high school, and as such I took advantage of that opportunity by taking too many AP courses!
          The best part about their curriculum was their offering of <a href="https://www.pltw.org/" target="_blank">Project Lead the Way</a> courses, a national initiative that helps high school students learn about engineering early in their academic careers.
          PLTW helped shape me into who I am today: without them, I would not be as successful as I am.
          In fact, I made my first attempt at a website for their capstone class, which you can find <a href="http://tylerbsmith.weebly.com/" target="_blank">here!</a>
