      During the pandemic, I became a bit restless--so I decided to start making something that I thought could improve our social gatherings (once we're allowed to have them again :)).
      This Spotify public queue system will let you create a "queue" for any of your public playlists on Spotify--anyone else can then follow the queue and request songs to be added onto the playlist.
      Only you have the power to approve and reject potential songs for your playlist.

    <!-- Heroku no longer supports free builds so idk if I'll ever bother putting it up again. -->
    <!-- <p>
      If you would like to see the application in action, check out <a
        href="https://spotify-request-queue.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">this build of it on Heroku.</a>
      If it appears to be down, please let me know!
